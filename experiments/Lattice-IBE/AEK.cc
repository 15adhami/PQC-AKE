This software is a computer program which purpose is to provide to the 
research community a proof-of-concept implementation of the identity-based
encryption scheme over NTRU lattices, described in the paper
"Efficient Identity-Based Encryption over NTRU Lattices", of
Léo Ducas, Vadim Lyubashevsky and Thomas Prest, available at
homepages.cwi.nl/~ducas/ , www.di.ens.fr/~lyubash/
and www.di.ens.fr/~prest/ .
