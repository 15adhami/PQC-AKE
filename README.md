### Post-Quantum Cryptography Experiments ###
This repo contains the Post-Quantum research work that I am doing for my Master's Thesis for UCSB (2016-2017).

- RLWE-AKE: Implementing an AKE based on the work of [Del Pino, Lyubashevsky, Pointcheval](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/435.pdf)
- RLWE-KEX: Implementing basic LWE and RLWE key exchange based on different PQC literatures [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp-IiVpgDlc),[2](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540887010),[3](https://cryptojedi.org/papers/newhope-20161119.pdf)
- Experiments: This is a temporary folder where I keep all my WIP, interesting tid-bits of code, or things that didn't work (but I kept anyways to look fondly at in the future).
