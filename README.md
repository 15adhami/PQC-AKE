### Post-Quantum Cryptography Experiments ###
This repo contains the Post-Quantum research work that I am doing for my Master's Thesis for UCSB (2016-2017).
- AKE: Implementing a Lattice-Based AKE based on the work of [Del Pino, Lyubashevsky, Pointcheval](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/435.pdf)
- MISC: This is a temporary folder where I keep all my WIP, interesting tid-bits of code, or things that didn't work (but I kept anyways to look fondly at in the future).

##Running the AKE##
```
cd AKE
make AKE
./AKE
```
